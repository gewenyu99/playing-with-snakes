Yeet coding

This is where I leet code and practice random stuff.

I've done a total of: 14 yeet codes so far.

The list is as follows:\
add_carry -> Python \
sum_to_zero -> Python \
two_sum -> C and Python\
max increase to keep city skyline -> Python\
longest_substring_no_repeat -> Python\
media_of_two_sorted_arrays -> Python\
candy -> Python - This doesn't answer that exact question, a more math-y solution \
longest_palindrome -> Python\
regex_matching -> Python (This one was a pain!) \
URLify -> Python \
check_permutation -> Python \
one_away -> Python \
stringRotation -> Python \
dijkstra -> Python \
network -> Python
