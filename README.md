Yeet coding

This is where I leet code and practice random stuff.

I've done a total of: 6 yeet codes so far.

The list is as follows:\
add_carry -> Python \
sum_to_zero -> Python \
two_sum -> C and Python\
max increase to keep city skyline -> Python\
longest_substring_no_repeat.py -> Python\
media_of_two_sorted_arrays.py -> Python\
