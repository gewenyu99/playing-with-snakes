Yeet coding

This is where I leet code and practice random stuff, cause I write garbage code :').

I've done a total of: 21 yeet codes so far.

I try to target the "hard" questions on leetcode, to practice stuff that my Data and Algo courses don't do a justice to cover.

The list is as follows:\
add_carry -> Python \
sum_to_zero -> Python \
two_sum -> C and Python\
max increase to keep city skyline -> Python\
longest_substring_no_repeat -> Python\
media_of_two_sorted_arrays -> Python\
candy -> Python - This doesn't answer that exact question, a more math-y solution \
longest_palindrome -> Python\
regex_matching -> Python (This one was a pain!) \
URLify -> Python \
check_permutation -> Python \
one_away -> Python \
stringRotation -> Python \
dijkstra -> Python -> It was fun learning Dijkstra with minimum instructions :D\
network -> Python \
keys and rooms -> Python
merge sorted array in place -> Python \
combinations -> If I used the ittertools lib, it's much shorter -> Python \
postorderTraversal -> **Binary and N-ary** -> recursive and iterative -> Python \
SumDistanceInTree -> **N^2 solution** -> Python -> It's too late I need to sleep :) \
